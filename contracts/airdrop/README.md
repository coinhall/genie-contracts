# [Readme Under Construction]

### Genie Flow Chart

![Flow chart](../../docs/imgs/genie-claims-flow.png)

### Claims Process:

1. User visits genie to request for a claim
2. Genie issues and signs a certificate [off-chain] to eligible user for the claim amount and address.
   Certificate details:

   1. Smart contract addr (required to prevent replay on other smart contracts)
   2. Claim amount
   3. Userâ€™s Address (Required to prevent someone else from claiming using this certificate)
   4. [secp256k1 signature](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secp256k1)

3. [Once only] User claims from smart contract using signed certificate.
   - In case of insufficient tokens in contract, user will be able to claim the remaining amount in the smart contract.
4. Smart contract sends coins to user :D

### Claim windows and actions allowed

![State Machine](../../docs/imgs/state%20machine%20genie.png)

Allowed actions during each state:

- Not started
  - Send tokens to smart contract address
  - Transfer unclaimed tokens
- On going
  - User claim tokens
- Ended
  - Transfer unclaimed tokens
- Invalid
  - Transfer unclaimed tokens

\*For now, Ended and Invalid will have the same behaviour.
